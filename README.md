## Testing

Just jotting down the steps I took so I don't forget/future reference:

1. Install mocha addon, pretender addon, mirage addon. 
2. set up `app/mirage/scenarios/default.js`.
3. set up `app/mirage/config.js` to stub web requests. 
4. set up facotries in `app/mirage/factories` directory. 
5. `ember generate acceptance-test routing`.
6. Write tests.
